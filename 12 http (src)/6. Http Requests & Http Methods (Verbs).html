<p>In the last lecture, we sent a POST request to a REST&nbsp;API.</p><p><strong>What is that?&nbsp;A&nbsp;POST request?&nbsp;And a REST&nbsp;API?</strong></p><p>There are<strong> different "kinds" </strong>of Http requests you could say - defined by the method (<code>POST</code>, <code>GET</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, ...) you attach to them (via the "<strong>method</strong>" you define on an outgoing request).</p><p>And the <strong>server</strong> to which you're sending those requests <strong>may then react in which ever way it is configured</strong> to react to incoming requests with different methods.</p><p>It may store data in a database for an incoming POST&nbsp;request, it may fetch data for a GET&nbsp;request.</p><p>Typically, servers are built to work as a "<strong>REST&nbsp;API</strong>"&nbsp;- that means they have <strong>clearly defined "endpoints"&nbsp;</strong>(<strong>URL&nbsp;+ Http method</strong> combinations) for which they do different things.</p><p>You can <strong>learn more about REST&nbsp;APIs</strong> (and how to build your own one!)&nbsp;with this <strong>free</strong> series:&nbsp;<a href="https://academind.com/learn/node-js/building-a-restful-api-with/what-is-a-restful-api-/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://academind.com/learn/node-js/building-a-restful-api-with/what-is-a-restful-api-/</a></p><p>Also make sure you understand, in general, <strong>how the web works</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://academind.com/learn/web-dev/how-the-web-works/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://academind.com/learn/web-dev/how-the-web-works/</a></p>
