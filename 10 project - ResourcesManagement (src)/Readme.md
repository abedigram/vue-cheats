### tips
- when u add an event listener (ex. click) on a component instance:
    - the event will be added to the root element of that component
    - this also works for any other tag property (ex. type property for button tag (if button is rooted tag in comp,) )
- trim() removes whitespaces around a string
- unshift() behaves like push() but adds at the begining of array
- mind about add and remove functions in TheResources.vue and the problems and findIndex() and splice() usage
- mind opening a dialog scenario
